                <h2>Geralt of Rivia</h2>
                <h5>Blaviken Witcher</h5>
                <b>Geralt was a witcher, who was tied to Ciri through the Law of Surprise. While initially reluctant to
                    accept his destiny, Geralt eventually came to terms with his fate. Despite their tumultuous
                    relationship, he also loved the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg.</b>
                <p>Geralt of Rivia, a well-known witcher, goes into Blaviken in search of an alderman after killing a
                    earkikimora in the nearby swamp. It's there that he meets a woman named Renfri in a tavern. She
                    greets him with beer rather than hateful looks. He eventually makes the acquaintance of Marilka, the
                    daughter of the alderman, and she directs him to a sorcerer named Stregobor, who took up the name
                    Master Irion from the long since deceased creator of the tower he inhabits. He lured Geralt into
                    town to hire him to assassinate Renfri. Stregobor explains his reasoning behind wanting to kill
                    Renfri. The Curse of the Black Sun, a solar eclipse that marked the imminent return of Lilit ‚Äî demon
                    goddess of the night ‚Äî whose sole purpose was to exterminate the human race. Lilit's path was to be
                    prepared by 60 women wearing gold crowns, who would fill the river valleys with blood. Stregobor
                    studied the girls born around the Black Sun, and he found internal mutations among them. He tried to
                    cure them, locking them in towers for safekeeping, but each girl died. He believes eliminating them
                    was the lesser evil. Renfri, princess of Creyden and daughter of Fredefalk, is after Stregobor. He
                    personally delivered Renfri in the middle of the afternoon, under the Black Sun and knows for
                    certain that she's the bringer of evil. In fear of Lilit's return, Stregobor dispatched someone to
                    follow Renfri into the woods. They later found him in the brush with Renfri's broach jammed in his
                    ear. She disappeared shortly thereafter and wouldn't reappear for another two years. Stregobor would
                    stop her himself except for the fact that she's resistant to magic given her mutation. She chased
                    Stregobor for years, plotting her revenge, and now she's tracked him to Blaviken. Despite
                    Stregobor's offer, Geralt only kills monsters.</p>

                    princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at
                    the time) as well as Queen Calanthe's granddaughter.</b>
                <p>After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what reward the witcher would like and
                    Geralt evoked the Law of Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri, unbeknownst to
                    Duny.</p>
                <p>Ciri was born in Skellige in Belleteyn of the following year[6] and initially, Calanthe ordered her
                    advisor Mousesack to kill Geralt,[7] wishing to break free from the Law of Surprise. Mousesack was
                    ready to go, as nobody simply refused the queen, but when he was summoned a short time later
                    Calanthe retracted the order without explanation.[8]</p>
                <p>Growing up, not much is known about Ciri's relationship with her parents, though it appeared Pavetta
                    adored her daughter, with others remarking how it was rare for her to be parted from Ciri. However,
                    this didn't stop Pavetta from secretly sending Ciri ashore just as the small family was set to sail
                    out from Skellige to Cintra.</p>

                    the crypt within the castle, where the king's sister Queen Adda was laid to rest. Rumor has it that
                    she was having an affair with a young man in town when she died and that she was with child, making
                    that child sole heir to the Temerian empire. The king fled the castle ignoring the rising death

                <p>When Francesca was younger she never considered the advantages of diplomacy. Believing direct action
                    was the best way to ensure survival in regards to the human expansion. When speaking of the
                    oppressive foreigners, she would often quote her father, Simlas Finn aep Dabairr, who had pure
                    contempt for the ape-men. Francesca thus abhorred her father's decision to not meet them on the
                    field of battle but rather sign a peace treaty with them. She saw this as a cowardly act and a spit
                    in the face of all elves who wanted to be free of persecution. She beseeched her father to change
                    his mind and fight the dh'oine. Simlas dismissed her pleas and forbade his daughter from getting
                    involved. His words would fall on deaf ears. Inspired by the words of Aelirenn, Francesca defied her
                    father's orders. She mustered her kin and joined the rebellion. She was lucky enough to survive the
                    slaughter, yet her brash nature had cost her much. She had lost most of her companions, and the
                    future potential of her race was all but obliterated. Her father, enraged by her betrayel disowned
                    her and would never speak to her again.[1]</p>

                    for years until shegot so hungry that she was forced to "slither out". Essentially an "overgrown
                    abortion". This angers Foltest, and he commands that everyone leave.</p>
